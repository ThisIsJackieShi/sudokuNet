## Abstract

Sudoku puzzle is a NP-complete problem. The default method for Sudoku solving algorithm uses backtracking to try out every possibility, which has exponential runtime. We want to know how well can we approach the result of these NP-complete problems using neural networks and deep learning in a polynomial runtime. 

In this project, we trained multiple convolutional/step-by-step neural network to solve Sudoku puzzles. 

We want to train a convolutional / LSTM network to solve Sudoku puzzles. The default method for Sudoku solving algorithm uses backtracking to try out every possibility. We want the network to solve the puzzle in a progressive manner, making one decision at a time without going back.
